# tetris_bevy

A simple Tetris clone made in Bevy.

This was more a challenge to myself to attempt creating the game without any tutorials/guidance save for the Bevy/Rust docs. No doubt there are better ways to approach this task, but I went into this totally blind.

Still has a few bugs with collision that I may try to iron out.

## TODO

- ~Tetromino Rotation~
- ~Scores~
- Fix collision bugs with rotation and acceleration
- (Maybe) replace the simple shapes with actual sprites.
